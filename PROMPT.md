  createdAt: timestamp
  updatedAt: timestamp
}

/players/{playerId}/attendance/{recordId} {
  date: string
  eventType: string
  status: string
  note: string
}

```

### üì¶ DELIVERABLES

- Firebase Console project set up and configured
- Firestore data schema in place
- SDK snippet returned for web app setup
- Ready-to-run React frontend that connects to Firebase
- Demo user and seeded player data

Start with Firebase setup, return the SDK config, and scaffold the data collections.
